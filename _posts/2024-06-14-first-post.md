# Testing out some basic markdown features.

Here is a paragraph.
All lines go into the paragraph
until a line break.

The line break starts a second paragraph.
Here comes a numbered list:
1. *Markdown should show this as italicized.*
1. **This should be bold**
1. ***This should be both bold and italicized***

Here's a bulleted list:
* A bullet point
* Another bullet point
  With an unbulleted, adjacent line.

# First-level MD header
## Second-level MD header
### Third-level MD header
#### Fourth-level MD header
I can insert HTML, but it must begin a line.
<h4>Fourth-level HTML header</h4>
